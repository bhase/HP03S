Requirements
============
the build is done with make, tests are done with CppUTest
(http://www.cpputest.org). To build and run the tests (for which this
Makefile is configured), you need to have installed CppUTest and put it in
../CppUTest or set the environment variable CPPUTEST_HOME.

For building with rake, you need ruby, rake and the gem rake-builder.

From the Hope page:
. Supply voltage 2.2v-3.6v
. -40°C to + 85°C operating range
. No external components required
. Integrated pressure sensor
. 300-1100hpa absolute Pressure Range

Requirements to run
===================
Externals:
- I2C (see I2C.h)
- GPIO pin (see GPIO.h)
- system function to wait milliseconds (see Time.h)
- 32 kHz on MCLK (not controlled by this module)
  This is explicit left out for power management of system
  If needed, an API could be introduced
  HP03S_Enable/HP03S_Disable which would control MCLK

Many of the required interfaces can be implemented
as macro depending on your platform if runtime is important.

Requirements to build
=====================
the build is done with make, tests are done with CppUTest
(http://www.cpputest.org). To build and run the tests (for which this
Makefile is configured), you need to have installed CppUTest and put it in
../CppUTest or set the environment variable CPPUTEST_HOME.

For building with rake, you need ruby, rake and the gem rake-builder.
